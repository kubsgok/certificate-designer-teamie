# Certificate Designer

A customizable certificate-generation feature integrated into the Teamie EdTech platform, enabling educators to design, preview, and issue digital certificates to students. This project was developed during my Software Engineer Internship at Teamie Pte. Ltd (SepÂ 2023Â â€“ DecÂ 2023).

## About The Project

During my internship, I:

* Developed and integrated a customizable certificate-generation feature into the Teamie edtech platform using Vue.js and React.js, allowing educators to create and issue digital certificates to students.
* Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless UI/UX alignment and system compatibility across teacher-facing modules.
* Presented the final feature to the CEO of Teamie and the principal of a partner school during a product showcase, highlighting technical implementation and user benefits.
